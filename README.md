A journey to build more environmentally-friendly LED lighting ... which turned into an obsession

# How on earth did i get here?
The last thing i remember hearing before tumbling down the hole was "_I'm late, I'm late! For a very important date! No time to say 'hello, goodbye,' I'm late, I'm late, I'm late!_".

We added a small covered open-air sitting area over our patio, and thought it would be nice to add some lighting for when sitting outside in the evening.  It was a conscious decision to not added outdoor electricity, to stay within budget and maintain the aesthetics.  The sitting area faces north, and gets very little sunlight, particularly during winter; initially solar-powered lighting did not seem like an option, but more on that later.

So the conclusion was to purchase some battery-powered LED lighting.  The product needed to be designed for outdoor usage, across all seasons' temperatures, and reasonably waterproof.  Optionally detecting darkness to turn on the lighting would be ideal, but the product must have a built-in timer, to extend the life of the batteries vs. the lighting on through the night.  Finally, the larger the battery type, the better.

Oh, and the product needed to be modestly priced, as I would need multiple strands of lighting to achieve the desired effect.  Plus being outdoors, invariably there would be failures that would need replacements.

In the end, most of the requirements could be met, but not all of them.  I found an LED lighting unit which does not have the darkness-on, but it does have a 6-hour on / 18-hour off timer.  It is designed for outdoor use and is reasonably sturdy and waterproof.

There are multiple lighting modes, such as alternating blinking, fade in and out, flashing which was just annoying and steady-on.

Being a simple man, we went with steady-on.

The lighting unit is operated by three "AA" batteries, at 4.5 Volts total.  I wondered: how long can three batteries last with LED lights steady-on for six hours each day.

I was somewhat surprised that the batteries actually lasted for about one month.

I thought "_At first i thought, that's not too bad ..._", swapped in three fresh "AA" batteries, reset the timer, and we were back in business.

But after a few months, i had this small pile of dead "AA" batteries.  Our town has a yard where they can be properly disposed, so we dropped them off.

A little while later, I sort-of felt guilty about the waste.

Being a degreed Electrical Engineer, there was only one thing to do: find a better way.

"_There must be a way to convert these LED lighting units to solar._"

But how?  I still have the same problem: minimal direct sunlight on the nort-facing side of the house.  And mounting a solar panel in such a way to obtain the needed sunlight would either be aesthetically-unpleasant, and most-likely susceptible to damage in high winds, ice/snow storms, and other inclement weather.

I also discovered how expensive good solar panels with high holding capacity can cost!

"_There must be a way ..._"

So I did something completely out of character for me: I set the problem aside and focused on other projects which were interesting and would help me maintain some semblence of sanity during COVID-19 lockdown.  My normal modus-operandi is to just press harder on the challenge until victory, but instead I decided to just take a break from all this.
