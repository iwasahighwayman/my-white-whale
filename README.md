# How on earth did I get here?
The last thing I remember hearing before tumbling down the hole was "_I'm late, I'm late! For a very important date! No time to say 'hello, goodbye,' I'm late, I'm late, I'm late!_".

We added a small covered open-air sitting area over our patio, and thought it would be nice to add some lighting for when sitting outside in the evening.  It was a conscious decision to not add outdoor electricity, to stay within budget and maintain the aesthetics.  The sitting area faces north, and gets very little sunlight, particularly during winter; initially solar-powered lighting did not seem like an option, but more on that later.

So the conclusion was to purchase some battery-powered LED lighting.  The product needed to be designed for outdoor usage, across all seasons' temperatures, and reasonably waterproof.  Optionally detecting darkness to turn on the lighting would be ideal, but the product must have a built-in timer, to extend the life of the batteries vs. the lighting on through the night.  Finally, the larger the battery type, the better.

Oh, and the product needed to be modestly priced, as I would need multiple strands of lighting to achieve the desired effect.  Plus being outdoors, invariably there would be failures that would need replacements.

# Iteration #1: Purchase batteries in bulk

In the end, most of the requirements could be met, but not all of them.  I found an LED lighting unit which does not have the darkness-on, but it does have a 6-hour on / 18-hour off timer.  It is designed for outdoor use and is reasonably sturdy and waterproof.

There are multiple lighting modes, such as alternating blinking, fade in and out, flashing which was just annoying and steady-on.

Being a simple man, we went with steady-on.

The lighting unit is operated by three "AA" batteries, at 4.5 Volts total.

In order to wrap around the two outdoor columns, plus across the span crossbeam, I needed a total of three LED lighting units.

I wondered: how long can three batteries last with LED lights steady-on for six hours each day.

I was somewhat surprised that the batteries actually lasted for about one month.

At first I thought "_That's not too bad ..._", swapped in three fresh "AA" batteries, times three lighting units so nine batteries total, reset the timer, and we were back in business.

But after a few months, I had this not-so-small pile of dead "AA" batteries.  Our town has a yard where they can be properly disposed, so we dropped them off.

A little while later, I sort-of felt guilty about the waste.

Being a degreed Electrical Engineer, there was only one thing to do: find a better way.

"_There must be a way to convert these LED lighting units to solar._"

But how?  I still have the same problem: minimal direct sunlight on the north-facing side of the house.  And mounting a solar panel in such a way to obtain the needed sunlight would either be aesthetically-unpleasant, and most-likely susceptible to damage in high winds, ice/snow storms, and other inclement weather.

I also discovered how expensive good solar panels with high holding capacity can cost!

"_There must be a way ..._"

So I did something completely out of character for me: I set the problem aside and focused on other projects which were interesting and would help me maintain some semblance of sanity during the COVID-19 lockdown.  My normal modus-operandi is to just press harder on the challenge until victory, but instead I decided to just take a break from all this.

# The first of potentially many tangential detours ... 

The holidays were approaching, and we didn't want our house to look like the Grinch lived here.  The front of our house faces south, and gets soaked with sunshine even in the winter - even more-so with snow providing reflection of the sunlight.

So time to purchase more LED lighting, with all the same requirements as for the back patio area lighting, except would be powered by solar.

To my pleasant surprise, I was able to find an LED lighting unit which met all the requirements, including darkness-on with a timer.

A couple pictures:

![Illuminated LED lighting - contents](/images/analog-FOUND-IT-blingstar-solar-christmas-lights-LED-string-retrofit-IMG_0217-solar-cell-led-lights-in-box-20220827.jpeg)

It even came with a remote control.

"_A what?_"

A remote control.

![Solar powered LED lighting - remote control](/images/analog-FOUND-IT-blingstar-solar-christmas-lights-LED-string-retrofit-IMG_0219-solar-cell-led-lights-remote-control-20220828.jpeg)

"_I'm a simple man ... why on earth do I need a remote control for my outdoor lighting?_"

But there it was.  I even tried to find a simpler, even less expensive product sans remote control.

Nope ... "_No soup for you!_" ... Take it with the remote control or move along.

Sigh ... OK.

We had gotten a cold spell just before the front yard LED lights arrived.  Most other homes already had their holiday lights installed.  I swear I heard one of the younger kids in the neighborhood, while waiting for the school bus, say "_Mommy, does the Grinch live in that house?_" to-which she replied "_Yes, I believe he does._"

OK, time to get busy.

The solar LED lights arrived a couple days later, just enough time for the ground to freeze into granite.  I unboxed the lights, which came with a small, say 6 inch, plastic spike which goes into the ground, and then there is an adjustable mounting bracket which goes from the spike to the solar cell which powers and controls the lighting.

I went outside, stretched out all the LEDs all over the front yard to untwist the wires, then knelt down to push the spike into the ground.  I mentioned the cold spell right?  "_Hmmm ... ground's pretty hard from the cold_".

I carefully inspected the plastic spike.  It seemed pretty sturdy.  "_It's probably just the very top of the ground that's frozen, so I'll just apply steadily increasing pressure until this spike breaks through to soft soil_".

I was using my normal modus operandi.

"_SNAP!!!_"

Sigh.

However, I had purchased a spare lighting unit for the front yard.  In our house, we have a saying: "_Pair and a spare_".  So I went inside and opened another lighting unit package.  I got the largest, scariest screwdriver I own, a hammer, and for good measure but thankfully unnecessary, the propane torch.  I will not be defeated by cold weather!  After creating a pilot hole, with the screwdriver and hammer, I successfully installed the front solar lights, coiling the LEDs artistically around the front bushes (it actually required two strings of lights to propose a nice display.)

That night I went to the window, and was shocked to discover that there was NO illumination!

"_A-Ha_" I said: I bet the battery in the solar cell was not charged, and I installed the lighting mid-late day.  Sure enough, the next evening we had lighting.

A couple days later: "_Mommy, did the Grinch move out of that house over there?_", to-which she replied "_Yes, I believe he did._"

A few days went by and we got our first snowfall.  I thought "_Our front lights will look so nice!_", and they did that evening.

And the next.

The third evening I went to the front window to admire my hard work and ... nothing.

No illumination reflecting gently against the evening snow.

Everyone other house's lights were on (I can already hear that kid saying "_Mommy ..._").

It was late, cold, and really no reason to go outside now in the darkness.  Better to mount an investigation in the morning.

The next day, the issue was apparent: the snow we received covered most of the solar cell, so no sunlight was getting to it.  You see, the plastic spike may be 6 inches long, but most of it goes into the ground, essentially placing the solar cells at ground level.  Add a few inches of snow and voila', no sunshine recharging the internal battery, thus no illumination.

No problem: I'll simply unbury the solar cell with my snow shovel, wide enough to ensure maximum sunlight hitting it.

I grabbed my trusty shovel, began carefully scraping back the snow to try to expose the solar cell.  Victory!

Remember how I mentioned earlier that it took two strings of lighting to get the desired effect: no problem, I'll just dig-out the other solar cell from the snow, so it can charge it's battery also.

"_Hmmm ... I think the other solar cell is right about here, so I'll just gently push the snow shovel like this until I feel the spike_"

I forgot that cold temperatures make plastic brittle.

"_SNAP!!!_"

Sigh.

OK.  I actually have one more set of lighting, and I'll use the spike from that package to replace the one I just broke.

Bingo.

That evening, I was rewarded with illumination.  Victory.  I will not be defeated.  Take that kid.

And then it snowed again.

Three days later: nothing.  Nada.  Darkness.

Not to be deterred, the answer was obvious:

![Front yard elevated solar panels](/images/analog-FOUND-IT-blingstar-solar-christmas-lights-LED-string-retrofit-IMG_0111-solarcells-on-dowels-outside-20220226.JPG)

# Returning to the main road, for now ... 

The holidays were, well, strange ... due to COVID.  We did manage to carefully spend time with some family, but as with everyone in the world, we were all impacted, and not in a good way.

With some spare time after the holidays, I returned to my back yard lighting conundrum.  How to obtain back yard patio illumination while being environmentally friendly and responsible?

# Iteration #2A: Hacking the solar panel

Stand-alone solar cells were pretty expensive, though had impressive charge capacity thus long light.  But even if I make that investment, I really have no aesthetic and durable installation mechanism.  Thinking back on the front yard saga, an answer was immediately: "_Might it be possible to find some way to use the front yard solar cells to power the back yard LED lights?_"

After all, I have two front yard lighting sets' solar cells which have two broken spikes ... maybe I can use those ... somehow?

Engineers who I know only love one thing more than creating something ... and that's taking something someone else created, cracking it open, and figuring out how it works.  Gold medal to the engineer who can also put it all back together and it still works, albeit with the obligatory "_one apparently extra and unnecessary screw still sitting on the workbench_" outcome, which for many of us is unavoidable.

Grabbing a less-scary screwdriver, I carefully opened one of the spare solar cells.  To my joy, it was relatively straight-forward to reverse-engineer (AKA "Hack").  I pretty quickly discovered that it was not difficult to remove a few mechanical and electronic components, isolating most of the electronics that ran the front yard lights (including the remote control receiver circuitry ... I still say "_Really?_"), producing a simple solar powered battery charger.

I really wanted to ensure that I understood the solar cell, and particularly the charging circuit for the Lithium Ion (Li-Ion) battery.  After spend more time researching for the integrated circuit than I should admit to (it was around 5 hours, but it was a snowy day and nothing else to do), I actually have relatively high confidence that I found the IC.  Please see the "datasheets" folder for the IC's PDF.  The datasheet's sample circuitry matched the solar cell's printed circuit board layout and passive components.  Given the cost of the solar cell lighting, I knew the IC must be dirt-cheap, and it is.

I contacted the manufacturer of the solar cell lighting, inquiring about the capacity of the internal Li-Ion battery.  After a couple days, I was informed that the battery has a capacity of 1200 milliamp-hours (mAH).

# Iteration #2B: Voltage conversion experimentation

Now armed with this information, it was time to design the power distribution from the front yard solar cells, to the back yard LED lighting.

First challenge: the back yard LED lighting was designed to run from three "AA" batteries thus 4.5 Volts.  But Li-Ion batteries have a lower 3.9 - 4.1 Volts level.  I therefore needed to do a voltage transformation to get to the necessary 4.5 Volts.

My first attempt was to place two hacked solar panels in parallel, then connect them thru the obligatory forward-bias diodes to prevent one solar cell's battery back-feeding the other solar cell's battery.  The diodes are critical for parallel-connected DC power sources, as their drain rates are never perfectly equal, and in a worst-case situation the absence of diodes can lead to overheating and possibly the smell of melting plastic and silicon.

I found a small, relatively efficient boost (step-up) voltage switching converter, calibrated it to 4.5 Volts output and began running my power delivery duration tests.  Each morning, I would place the solar panels out on the front steps, to be charged through the day.  Then that evening, I would connect the solar cells as described to a single spare back yard LED lighting unit, monitoring the converter voltage through the evening into the next day.

The LED lighting unit consumes approximately 100 milliamps (mA), so theoretically each 1200 milliamp-hour solar cell battery should supply about 12 hours of power, so for two batteries that should be about 24 hours.

Such idealized math rarely works out in the real world, and this was the case here.

Repeated experiments over a couple weeks showed that after about 14 hours, the solar cell batteries would begin to deplete and their voltage would drop.  The LEDs would begin to dim, and by 18 hours, the solar cell batteries had no charge left.

The problem is that the required diodes drop approximately 1/2 Volt, with 100 mA flowing through each diode.  That's pure wasted power.  And the switching boost voltage convert probably had an efficiency rating of perhaps 90-ish percent, so again more wasted power.

And in the back yard, I have three LED lighting units, each consuming 100 mA.

With this battery configuration, the front yard solar cells and batteries would only power the back yard LED lighting for one evening.  Solar cells have been around since the 1960's, so there has been a lot of time to improve them to require less and less sunlight to produce an equivalent power output.  If the next day was overcast, the batteries would still mostly or fully charge.  But if the next day was very cloudy and very little sunshine, then no LED illumination that evening.

Time to try something different ...

Buck (step-down) switching voltage converters tend to be a little more efficient than their boost cousins.

![Buck step-down switching voltage converter](/images/analog-FOUND-IT-blingstar-solar-christmas-lights-LED-string-retrofit-IMG_0113-voltage-buck-down-converter-20220226.JPG)

So now if instead I configure the solar cell batteries to be in series, I can eliminate the need of the two diodes (and their associated power waste).

The resultant 4.1 x 2 or 8.2 Volt power supply was then bucked down to 4.5 Volts, and the experiments were repeated.

After a few rounds of "charge all day" then "drain all night" over the course of a week or so, the single spare backyard LED lighting unit consuming 100 mA would operate at 4.5 Volts for 21 or 22 hours.

So when dividing that time window by three, for the three actual backyard LED lighting units running for six hours, the solar cell batteries should still have some charge remaining the next morning.

# Iteration #2C: Electrical transmission lines

In order to get the front yard solar cell batteries' power to the back yard LED lighting units, I'll need to run some two-conductor insulated wire.

Determining the optimal diameter of the wire, called the "gage", specifically "American wire gage" (AWG), is part science and part art.

The smaller the gage number, the larger the wire diameter, and the lower power loss due to the wire.

But as the gage size increases, the wire gets more expensive and more stiff and difficult to handle.

Plus although low voltage, the wire will be outside so I wanted double-insulated conductors.

After performing some calculations, and then reading some reviews, I settled on using 22 AWG twisted copper wire.

Toilette paper was definitely not the only supply chain disrupted during COVID, though it certainly got the most news coverage.

I began searching all the likely distribution channels for a 100 foot coil of 22 AWG wire, and began to panic.

"_Out of stock_"

"_Unavailable for the foreseeable future_"

"_Would you like to be placed on the backorder list?_"

No I don't want to be on the backorder list ... I just want to purchase my spool of wire!

Finally after more patient searching, I found a spool, and I should receive it in a couple days.  Without looking too closely, I added it to my online shopping cart and proceeded to checkout.

Then I saw the total bill.

"_Are you kidding me?!?!_"

Sigh ... I made the purchase, rationalizing that even with this gouging, I really had no alternative, and this next phase of my project would keep me sane during COVID and was still less expensive than a good therapist.

# Iteration #2D: Architecture decisions

My wire arrived on the scheduled day mid-week, but I knew this was going to turn into an all-day ordeal running and connecting the wire.

And whatever you do, make sure you measure not twice but three or four times, before cutting the wire to length!

First I installed the buck voltage converter into a relatively waterproof enclosure (more on that later):

![Hacked solar panel battery charger](/images/analog-FOUND-IT-blingstar-solar-christmas-lights-LED-string-retrofit-IMG_0206-buck-down-voltage-converter-in-enclosure-20220827.jpeg)

I placed the converter enclosure in the front yard, elevated by a couple bricks to try to keep it out of the snow, and connected the solar cells.

I then ran my 22 AWG wire up to a waterproof termination / distribution box in the back yard, on the ground on the north side of the west column, which would take in the power wire from the front yard voltage converter enclosure and connect that to three smaller, more discreet wires that would be fed to each of the three LED lighting units mounted on the columns of the covered patio area.

When I originally attached the LED lighting controllers to the columns, I had a "50-50 shot" as to which column the unit with the LEDs spanning the crossbeam should be mounted.  This was all done back when I was using the "AA" batteries, so the choice did not seem too relevant.

As you've probably guessed: the crossbeam LED light controller (and east column controller) were mounted on the east column, and the solar cell power wire and distribution enclosure were at the base of the west column.

Now, this sounds like a small concern, but turned out to be "_a significant (bad) decision which would prove to be difficult and labor-intensive to refactor_".

This is called an "_Architecture Decision_" ... and I blew it.

The covered patio area is actually quite tall.  In order to run the LED lighting, I needed to use my 9 foot wooden (AKA weighs a ton) step ladder.  Once again I dragged it out of the garage and around to the back yard, so that I could run the smaller, more discreet and aesthetic wire along the crossbeam and down to now two LED lighting controllers, mounted on the east column.  The entire effort took close to an hour, to make things look nice.

Next, I stripped the smaller, more discreet wires, to begin connecting them to the two east column hanging LED controllers.

Upon stripping the insulation, I noticed the actual copper wire itself was awfully small in diameter.  You see, I purchased a 50 foot white telephone extension wire.  Telephone wire has historically been 26 AWG, but these copper strands were definitely far smaller.

So now I'm concerned about the voltage drop occurring as now not one but two LED controllers, at 100 mA each or 200 mA total, would be traversing this tiny pair of wires.

I temporarily alligator-clipped the two LED controllers to the tiny pair of wires, and sure enough, instead of 4.5 Volts, the controllers were receiving 3.75 Volts, wasting almost 25% of the needed power across the tiny pair of wires.

But it was now mid-afternoon, and bitter cold in early February.  I could just barely feel the tips of my fingers, so I chose to move forward as-is, and complete the hookups of the LED controllers, and see how the lights' brightness looked that night after dark.

# Iteration #2E: Soldering iron gymnastics

I contemplated multiple ways to connect the power wires to the LED controllers.

I made the decision that there's "_no going back to battery-powered_" operation.

So I ran an extension cord, and got my trusty soldering iron.

The LED controller boxes for the lights that ran up the columns were located near the bottom of the columns (high enough in elevation to be above the snowline of a typical snow storm).  I soldered the power wires to the battery springs inside the LED controller enclosure.  It was a difficult job holding the wire and enclosure still with one hand, and then feed the solder into the soldering iron tip pressed against the wire and springs.  After some trial and error, manual dexterity prevailed, albeit with a few splatters of bright silver solder onto our dark gray patio stones.  I discovered for the smaller splatters, I could use my pocket knife to lift the splatters completely.  But for one larger splatter, there would remain some small remnant of the splatter probably forever.

The crossbeam LED lights controller was mounted higher up on the east column.  I was not comfortable soldering from the large, heavy 9 foot step ladder, so I put it back into the garage and instead used a two-step step stool.  I then set forth, balancing on the step stool, to perform the same soldering technique.  I turned out the step stool proved to make things feel far more rickety, and I realized I was applying far too much solder to the iron, with this ever-growing ball of bright silver solder hanging precariously off the end of the iron, over my dark gray stones.

Now, you need to understand that solder melts between 350 and 400 degrees fahrenheit.

And it was a human, natural reaction when I saw the ball of solder drip off the iron, headed towards the patio stones.

After yelling "_No!_", I did what nobody should do: I reached out my (ungloved) hand and caught the white-hot solder.

Remember how earlier I mentioned that it was a bitter cold day, growing even colder as the sun began to set.  I'm not sure if not being able to feel my fingers made the situation better or worse, but upon smelling burning flesh, my hand reflexed and I threw the solder off the patio and into the snow.  I flung the soldering iron away from me, nearly fell off the step stool, and ran for the snow bank and plunged my hand into it.

After catching my breath, and giving my hand a chance to start working again, I did successfully manage to make the final solder connections to the third and last LED controller.

It was nearly dark, and my hand ached.  I put the soldering iron, step stool and other items away.

It was time for a "_quarantini_" and see the results of my now solar powered back yard LED lights.

# Iteration #2F: Soldering iron gymnastics - round two

Well, as you can imagine, it was visibly apparent that the east column and crossbeam LED lights were dimmer than the west column lights, due to the voltage drop across the tiny telephone extension wires.

The 22 AWG wire used to go from the front yard solar cells and batteries, to the three back yard LED lights, was just too thick in diameter ... and given every foot the white outer insulation had dark black lettering with the manufacturer's information ... it would just be too visible and ugly to use across the crossbeam.

I searched for white, thin wire in 26 AWG, but none was to be found, let alone without manufacturer's lettering.

What could I do?

In the words of Pooh: "_Think think think ..._"

And then it came to me: telephone extension wires come in both two conductor (red and green) and four conductor (red, green, yellow and black) versions.  I originally purchased and strung two conductor telephone wire, which resulted in a 0.75 Volt drop.  If instead I use four conductor telephone wire, and use two conductors twisted together at both ends to carry the positive power, and the other two conductors twisted together at both ends to carry the neutral/ground power, then theoretically that should halve the resistance.  Instead of a 0.75 Volt drop, it should be more like 0.38 Volt drop.  Not ideal but better.

I was able to find and purchase a 50 foot length of white four conductor telephone wire, with no manufacturer lettering.  It was reasonably priced and arrived in a few days.

Before dragging the overweight wooden 9 foot step ladder back out of the garage, and go thru the effort of replacing the two conductor telephone wire with the four conductor telephone wire, I did an experiment.  I measured out the necessary four conductor telephone wire length, measuring three times before cutting.  I then twisted the ends and tested an extra pair of LED lighting units, with a 4.5 Volt supply on the hobby bench.  Sure enough, upon turning on the two LED lighting units, the power to them dropped to about 4.1 Volts, as anticipated.

Armed with these results, I took to the task of collecting the heavy 9 foot step ladder, de-soldering the two conductor telephone wire, removed it and replaced it with the four conductor telephone wire, and re-soldered everything.

Darkness arrived and I turned on the three LED lights.  To my satisfaction, even though the east column and crossover lights had a lower voltage than the west column, all three illuminated with a similar brightness.

# Iteration #3: Time for a complete refactor

The three solar cell powered back yard LED light string ran relatively well thru most of winter and mid-spring.  Once in a while we would get a few very cloudy days in a row, resulting in no light show after a couple nights, but it was infrequent enough to just turn the lights back on after the first sunny day.

But then I noticed that although the LEDs would illuminate once I went out to the patio and turn them on, they would only glow for an hour or two then go dark.

I assumed that after about a year and a half of repeated daily solar cell charging and evening LED lighting discharging of the solar cell's internal Li-Ion batteries, the batteries were starting to fail to hold a charge.

I still felt pretty good about my little odyssey: the two solar cell Li-Ion batteries are about the size of two "C" cell batteries.  Had I simply used three sets of three "AA" batteries over 18 months, that would have been 9 x 18 or over 160 "AA" batteries taken to the town yard for disposal.

BTW, I neglected to mention early-on: rechargeable "AA" batteries do not have nearly the milliamp-hour capacity of a normal alkaline battery.  By my calculations, would have needed three sets of nine rechargeable, plus the actual charging unit.  My calculations showed that every 2nd or at most 3rd evening, I would need to swap out nine depleted rechargeable "AA" batteries for freshly charged ones.  That would grow old quickly.

Spring was moving towards summer, the days were getting longer, and the absence of evening illumination to chase away the drearies was less of a concern.

Finally, one weekend day I had nothing particular to do, so I decided to check out the lighting and see if I could figure out what was wrong.  I took out both a voltmeter, and even a small portable digital oscilloscope.  The voltage readings and waveforms were totally screwy.  After some poking and prodding, I discovered the problem: one of the LED lighting controllers had gone bad, and was essentially powered-on full time.  This was pulling power 24x7 from the batteries, which were never completely solar-charging.

By far, the most painful and difficult string of lights to replace are the ones on the crossbeam, as once again the heaviest 9 foot ladder ever created by humans must be collected, setup and moved multiple times.

Of course that's the lighting unit which failed!

I was still having occasional nightmares about catching small 350 - 400 degrees fahrenheit solder balls bare-handed, so I made the decision that if I must make yet again an investment of time to replace the failed crossbeam lighting string, I'm re-architecting the entire design based on lessons-learned.

The first new requirement is: "_No more free handed hot solder gymnastics on ladders and step stools_"

The second new requirement is: "_Need to figure out how to further reduce the voltage drop across tiny telephone extension wires, albeit the four conductor version_"

The third new requirement is: "_Need to be able to swap-out failed LED lighting controllers more easily, without requiring hoisting of Ladder-Zilla_"

The fourth new requirement is: "_Improve the aesthetics of the solution_"

The LED lighting controller boxes are relatively discreet, and when mounted on the north side of the columns, are not visible from the sitting area.

Here is a picture of one, with the battery access door open:

![Factory LED lighting controller enclosure](/images/analog-FOUND-IT-blingstar-solar-christmas-lights-LED-string-retrofit-IMG_0215-led-lights-battery-case-open-20220827.jpeg)

It occurred to me that most of the factory enclosure is battery space, and in fact the controller printed circuit board itself is quite small, underneath the left edge of the enclosure.

Here are three controller boards which have been removed from the factory enclosure:

![LED lighting controllers](/images/analog-FOUND-IT-blingstar-solar-christmas-lights-LED-string-retrofit-IMG_0207-led-lights-controller-boards-20220827.jpeg)

That's a little metal box used to hold your average-sized gift/credit card, so you can get a sense of how tiny the LED controller printed circuit boards are.

And, there are only four connections: two for power, and two to drive the LEDs.

I found and purchased a nice little IP-67 rated waterproof enclosure, some M2.5M (2.5 mm) standoffs, screws and nuts, and 2.54 mm terminal blocks.

After a day or so at the hobby bench with a piece of pre-drilled and tinned printed circuit board material, I was able to successfully prepare my new "_Unified Multi-Zoned LED Lighting Controller Apparatus_".

![Unified Multi-Zoned LED Lighting Controller Apparatus](/images/analog-FOUND-IT-blingstar-solar-christmas-lights-LED-string-retrofit-IMG_0203-original-electronics-in-waterproof-enclosure-20220827.jpeg)

Four terminal blocks are integrated with the three controller boards.  The red terminal block is to receive the 4.5 Volt power supply from the solar cell batteries and buck voltage converter, with the "+" and "-" supplies connected to all three LED controllers.  The remaining three black, green and blue terminal blocks are each connected to a single LED controller's output LED driving connectors.

This enclosure will be placed on the ground on the north side of the west column, replacing the prior power junction / distribution enclosure.

The last step was to once again collect Ladder-Zilla, and completely redo the telephone extension cable wiring.  In this new architecture, it is no longer power to the LED lighting controller boxes distributed around the sitting area.  Instead, the four conductor telephone wire is used only to carry the LED illumination signals.  One discreet length of the four conductor telephone wire was laid across the crossbeam, to feed the LED signals for the east column lighting.  Next the crossbeam lighting string was taken down and flipped, so that the LED signal leads were closest to the west column, drastically reducing the length (and parasitic resistance) of the four conductor telephone wire.  Also, the four conductor telephone wires were no longer carrying 2 x 100 mA for both the east and crossbeam light strings - each telephone wire only carried the 95 mA or so used to illuminate a single string of LED lights.  So even though there was a relatively long length of telephone wire from the west column "_Unified Multi-Zoned LED Lighting Controller Apparatus_" to the east column string of LEDs, that undesired voltage drop due to the telephone wire resistance split in half again, yielding nearly the same peak-to-peak voltage across each of the strings of LEDs.

I was forced to do a third, final round of soldering iron gymnastics for the east column's LED string, mostly because I was too lazy to unwind that lighting string and perform the soldering on the hobby bench.  But the other two LED strings were bench-soldered, and going forward, if an LED string failed, I'll simply take down that failed string and bench-solder the necessary length telephone wiring replacement.

This new architecture fulfilled all the new requirements, and improved upon the implementation for the original requirements.

# Iteration #4: Just can't leave it alone ...

My next and perhaps geekiest indulgence began.

I began to think: "_What if the strings of LED lighting (which are now optimally configured to maximize illumination and simplify maintenance) continue to work perfectly, but more of the controller boards burn up, and there are continued supply chain issues?_"

Obviously, as an Electrical Engineer, I should be able to recreate the LED controller functionality, right?

OK, let's get to work reverse-engineering the LED controller, beginning with trying to understand the LED signals themselves.

Unlike the the front yard solar cell lights, which use a three-wire LED configuration and relatively high voltage (+/- 60 Volts peak-to-peak ... I nearly fried my low-cost digital oscilloscope which has a 40 Volt max input range), the back yard LED lights use a two-wire LED configuration with a +/- 5.8 Volts peak-to-peak range (approximately 2.85 Volts in each alternating direction of LED drive.)

Given that there is only a single 4.5 Volt power supply, the LED signals are created using a "push-pull" or "H-Bridge" circuit.  For the first half of the square wave period, one of the LED driver connectors is positive 2.85 Volts relative to the other connector.  Then when the second half of the square wave period begins, the polarity flips and now what was positive 2.85 Volts is now negative by the same amount.  When the LED signals are in a positive-negative polarity, half of the LEDs illuminate and the other half are off.  Then when the LED signal polarity flips, the illuminated / off LEDs are reversed.  I believe this is achieved by single LEDs of anode / cathode direction alternating with single LEDs of cathode / anode direction LEDs.  The directional single LEDs are then wired in parallel to create the full length of the LED lighting string.  The string of LEDs are hermetically sealed with shrink wrap tubing, and to truly dissect the LED string and confirm this assumption will render that string unusable.  So for now I just accept that this assumption is how the LEDs are actually wired.  Single LEDs in each direction makes sense, since 2.85 Volts is approximately what would be needed to illuminate a single white LED.

Also, at first glance, the square wave appears to be approximately 110 Hz, but on more careful inspection, there is actually a 1.65 KHz sub-harmonic "inner" square wave within the 110 Hz "outer" square wave.  Though I am focusing on "steady-on" of the LEDs, this is how the LED controller creates the other lighting patterns such as chasing and fading, by adjusting (pulse width modulating) the "outer" square wave to be other than a steady 110 Hz.

The inner square wave sub-harmonic does not really add much value for the "steady-on" illumination pattern ... we really only need any square wave which oscillates faster than the human eye can detect alternation, which is about 30 Hz on average.

First we need to start off with a square wave generator, in electrical engineering terms an "astable multivibrator".

One possible circuit is using a TL431 precision voltage reference for the signal gain needed to oscillate:

![TL431-based multivibrator schematic](/images/analog-FOUND-IT-blingstar-solar-christmas-lights-LED-string-retrofit-tl431-multivibrator-schematic-20220827.png)

As indicated in the schematic, unfortunately this circuit's square wave is produced with a 2 Volt bias (offset).

The bias / offset can be easily removed with a de-biasing circuit:

![De-Biasing circuit schematic](/images/analog-FOUND-IT-blingstar-solar-christmas-lights-LED-string-retrofit-nmos-debias-schematic-20220827.png)

Alternatively, there are many examples of multivibrators which use more common bipolar junction transistors (BJTs), or for even lower quiescent power consumption, metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs):

![N-Channel MOSFET-based multivibrator schematic](/images/analog-FOUND-IT-blingstar-solar-christmas-lights-LED-string-retrofit-nmos-multivibrator-schematic-20220827.png)

Next, in order to drive the "push-pull" or "H-Bridge" LED driver circuit, we need to create a complementing invert of the square wave.  In fact, we want to gang two of these in series, with the first inverting circuit primarily providing a high input impedance buffer, and then the second inverter being the actual "not" signal of the preceding buffer.

![Inverting circuit schematic](/images/analog-FOUND-IT-blingstar-solar-christmas-lights-LED-string-retrofit-nmos-inverter-schematic-20220827.png)

Next, the last circuit in the essential circuits to illuminate the LEDs as "steady-on" is the actual "push-pull" or "H-Bridge" circuit.

This can be created using a combination of BJTs and MOSFETs:

![NMOS PNP Push-Pull H-Bridge schematic](/images/analog-FOUND-IT-blingstar-solar-christmas-lights-LED-string-retrofit-nmos-pnp-push-pull-h-bridge-schematic-20220827.png)

Or created using only MOSFETs:

![NMOS PMOS Push-Pull H-Bridge schematic](/images/analog-FOUND-IT-blingstar-solar-christmas-lights-LED-string-retrofit-nmos-pmos-push-pull-h-bridge-schematic-20220827.png)

It is also possible to create the push-pull / H-Bridge with BJTs, but no example is provided here.

This is a breadboard of these circuits chained together:

![Breadboard circuit of essential sub-circuits to produce steady-on LED illumination breadboard](/images/analog-FOUND-IT-blingstar-solar-christmas-lights-LED-string-retrofit-IMG_0195-multivibrator-debias-inverter-push-pull-h-bridge-20220827.jpeg)

One word of caution: due to the use of discrete, relatively higher power transistors in the push-pull / H-Bridge circuit, the voltage produced is nearly double the voltage produced by the factory LED controller integrated circuit.  In testing momentarily, the higher voltage did not seem to damage the string of LEDs, but that may not be true if operated at this higher voltage over an extended window of time.  

Given that the current through each of the three LED lighting strings is approximately 100 mA, so 300 mA total, we could possibly use one 3 Ohm resistor between each of the push-pull / H-Bridge driver contacts and the actual string of LEDs, for a total of 6 Ohms total inline with the LED strings.  With 300 mA flowing thru the resistors, this would reduce the 4.5 Volt peaks by 1.8 Volts, resulting in 2.7 Volt peaks, or 5.4 Volts peak-to-peak.  Some experimentation with resistor values is probably required.  This would be slightly wasteful use of limited solar cell battery power capacity, though any other option will probably waste even more power.

Next, it would be nice if a darkness detector could be used to turn on the LED lights.

Here is one proven circuit which uses a 555 Schmitt trigger to that when the phototransistor is just barely switching light vs. dark detection, there is no "bounce" or "banging" of the output signal when right on that threshold between light vs. dark.

![Phototransistor-based darkness detector using a 555 Schmitt trigger for debounce schematic](/images/analog-FOUND-IT-blingstar-solar-christmas-lights-LED-string-retrofit-phototransistor-555-schmitt-trigger-schematic-20220827.png)

Here is a breadboard wiring of this circuit:

![Phototransistor-based darkness detector using a 555 Schmitt trigger for debounce breadboard](/images/analog-FOUND-IT-blingstar-solar-christmas-lights-LED-string-retrofit-IMG_0197-phototransistor-555-schmitt-trigger-20220827.jpeg)

# Iteration #5: Does anybody really know what time it is?

If the solar cell's battery was a much larger capacity, I may be less concerned about limiting the time that the LED lighting strings are illuminated, to say the evening hours we're actually awake to enjoy them.  But the solar cell's capacity is quite limited, so we really only want the lighting strings to run 4 or 5 or 6 hours after they turned on, be it from darkness detection, or as is the factory controller a simple 24-hour 6-hour "ON" timer which begins when you turn the lighting on.

Having designed and built many "flip flop" binary ripple counter circuits over the years, I figured I would just get ahead of the curve and order a dozen of each 4060 and 4020 counter integrated circuits (ICs), so they'll be here when ready to breadboard and then actually for-real build all this.

OK, now I feel really, really old.

The 4000 series of ICs were table-stakes chips to build systems.  It turns out in the year 2022, they are somewhat obtainable in surface mount packaging, but traditional dual in-line packages (DIPs) are unavailable, take weeks or months to receive after ordering, or are ridiculously expensive.

If I rummage around in my old electronics boxes, I probably can find a handful of each of these.

But that won't work.

"_How am I supposed to create my dynasty as the overarching leader in producing environmentally-friendly LED lighting solutions, if I cannot obtain the necessary raw materials?_"

I suppose I could subcontract the actual assembly of the devices to a 3rd-party, but that will just cut into my assured future mega-profits.

# Iteration #6: To the moon and back

I have been using Raspberry PI's for small, odd projects for a while now, but to-date I have never used the "Pico" model, which is not a single board computer (SBC) running Linux, but rather a small, sub-ten-dollar system-on-a-chip (SOC) based on Raspberry PI's own ARM CPU, the RP4020.  It has just enough periphery components to plug into a breadboard or printed circuit board, then add any additional components one needs for her/his specific project.

There is also a Pico clone from the vendor Seeed Studio (no, that's not misspelled ... there really are three "e" letters in the vendor's name).  Although the official Raspberry PI Pico is very small, about a third of a post-it note, the Seeed Studio XIAO RP2040 is 1/3rd the size of the Pico.  The Seeed device costs double or more than the Pico, but that's still less than $15.

Looking at the specifications, the RP2040 SOC contains thousands (tens of thousands?) of times the horsepower of the IBM computer that propelled US astronauts to the moon and back.

I should be able to use this to make back yard lighting illuminate, with all the requirements met.

I'm currently using a late 2018 Intel i9 16 GB RAM Macbook Pro, to develop, compile and debug the RP2040 microcode / firmware which runs on either the Pico or XIAO.  I needed to install a small number of ARM development toolchains, but the steps are well-documented by Raspberry PI, and the resultant binary can run on either device (just be sure to only target input / output (IO) available on the much smaller and pin-reduced XIAO device.)

Here is a picture of my XIAO breadboarded.  The black wire when pulled down to ground represents my darkness detector detecting darkness.  The green wire when pulled down to ground represents a momentary push button which after three seconds toggles the power-on state from off to on, or vice-versa.  The orange is the output pin which indicates whether the LEDs should be illuminated or not.

![Seeed Studio XIAO RP2040 breadboard](/images/analog-FOUND-IT-blingstar-solar-christmas-lights-LED-string-retrofit-IMG_0200-seeed-studio-xiao-rp2040-20220827.jpeg)

The source code for as much of the basic functionality as I currently have running is available in the "source" subdirectory.  It currently toggles the LED illumination on for one second then off for two seconds.  The code started with a combination of the serial USB sample SDK code, plus the blink sample SDK code, plus my own logic additions.

# Time to go learn things ... and continue to search for my white whale

And this is where this odyssey, in fact obsession, currently stands.

Next steps are to better-understand the Pico/XIAO capabilities, as initial research proposes that much of what was implemented in analog hardware might be reproducible directly within the digital SOC.

My intent is to continue to add to this work, providing updates as progress is made.

# All Hallows' Eve 2022 Updates

Veni Vidi Vici ...

The Seeed Studio Raspberry PI implementation is working as expected, with the latest source included in the "source" directory.  As provided, once the light detector indicates darkness, the LEDs will illuminate on for one second then off for two seconds.  The source should be adjusted for the number of minutes/hours on then off.

I have a backlog item to add a "timer delay after darkness detected" to the source.  This would allow, for example, darkness to be detected late afternoon (such as mid-winter) but the LEDs not turn on until a few hours later that evening.

Here are some pictures of the wired-up printed circuit board, and the schematic.  It is important to remember that the Seeed Studio can accept a 5 Volt power supply (4.5 Volts also tested successfully), but operates internally at 3.3 Volts.  This means all signals into the Seeed, such as the momentary-contact switch and darkness sensor, must have a following MOSFET/BJT in an open source/collector configuration using the Seeed's internal pull-up resistors.

N.B.: The push-pull/H-Bridge MOSFETs do not need to be nearly as high-powered as presented here.  These devices were selected primarily because they are actually easier to find and less expensive than TO-92 packaged transistors, particularly for P-Channel, and consume the same printed circuit board real estate when mounted vertically.

Here is the pinout of the Seeed Studio board - the C source code uses the light gray micropython pin numbers.

# November 2022 Waning Gibbous Updates

Indeed, as shared above in the "All Hallows' Eve 2022 Updates", I have working Raspberry PI Pico software which will manage the LEDs, however I am still currently using the vendor-provided LED controllers.

Frequently, we would have a very sunny day, suggesting the solar cells would fully charge the Li-Ion batteries to full capacity, which should allow the LEDs to illuminate through and beyond the full six (6) hour timed session.

Sadly, more frequently than desired, less than four (4) hours after the LEDs illuminated, they would go dark.  On multiple evenings, I would immediately mount an evening investigation, and sure enough, the buck voltage converter's "power available" LED was also dark, indicating it was receiving no power from the batteries.

Being a student and strong supporter of the "Scientific Method" to understanding, I began an analysis of what might be transpiring under the cover of darkness.

Were rabid rabbits knawing through the wires?

Were kids down the street tapping into my top-secretly-modified solar battery voltage source to power their $5,000 gaming-laptops to play "Overwatch"?

Did foreign nation-states just execute an "Electro-Magnetic Pulse" ("EMP") surgically and strategically targeting my solar-based, environmentally-friendy Minimum Viable Product ("MVP"), as they were secretly trying to corner the market in this multi-trillion dollar consumer space?

Or did something just "burn up"?

I am blessed to have many friends, and my friends are gifted in many ways.  

Folks like me have thoughtful sayings, two (2) of which for me are:

1.  If you think you are the smartest person in the room, then that just proves you are not.

2.  If you actually are the smartest person in the room, time to find a new room where you are not.

In the end, it was (my) human error of not fact-checking what was really going on.

What was really going on?

I was NOT getting the power efficiencies which I had previously experienced when building my own power/voltage converters!

Below are some pictures of these details.

![Buck converter Vdd to LED Vpp correlation](/images/analog-FOUND-IT-blingstar-solar-christmas-lights-LED-string-retrofit-IMG_0229-buck-converter-vdd-to-led-vpp-correlation-20221110.JPG)

![Buck converter power conversion efficiency](/images/analog-FOUND-IT-blingstar-solar-christmas-lights-LED-string-retrofit-IMG_0232-buck-converter-power-efficiency-testing-20221110.JPG)

![Buck converters power conversion efficiency comparison](/images/analog-FOUND-IT-blingstar-solar-christmas-lights-LED-string-retrofit-IMG_0236-buck-converter-efficiency-comparison-20221117.JPG)

I cannot currently explain why the buck-converter architecture worked through most of last winter; it's possible that colder / freezing weather is a variable or influencer here, and perhaps that architecture was always "just barely on the edge of working" ... honestly not certain at this time.

Back to the drawing board ... yet again.

# "Simplicity is often best" Updates

To improve the "power efficiency" story, I wanted to find a way to power the LEDs without a buck (or boost) voltage / power converter.

The vendor-specified voltage is 3 "AA" 1.5 volt batteries in series, or 4.5 volts.

The solar cell Li-Ion battery is 4.1 volts.

So the $64,000 question becomes: how low can these factory LED controllers go?

After some higly-scientific testing, it turns out that the drop-out voltage of the factory LED controller, where the controller ceases to operate, is around 2.5 Volts:

![LED Controller drop-out voltage](/images/analog-FOUND-IT-blingstar-solar-christmas-lights-LED-string-retrofit-IMG_0235-drop-out-voltage-20221117.JPG)

But the three (3) 4.1 volt solar batteries, if used in parallel, will require forward-bias diodes in each path to prevent battery voltage differences cross-charging each other ... this can have a spectacular outcome, not in a good way.

But under the three (3) x 50 milliamp load of the three (3) LED strings, would certainly result in the anticipated 0.7 volt drop across the forward-bias diodes from the 4.1 volt (at best) solar battery, yielding 3.4 volts.

Minus the 0.25 volts drop across the length of 22 AWG wire going from front yard solar cell batteries to back yard LED controllers.  So now (at best) we're looking at 3.1 volts at the beginning of the evening illumination, with an LED controller cutout around 2.5 volts.

That leaves 0.5 volts of difference between a nice winter's eve illumation and cold hard winter darkness.

What to do Pooh?  Yes, I know ... "_think think think ..._"

# "Schottky in the dark" Updates

The mind is an interesting thing.  One may rack her/his brain on a problem for hours, with the outcome of "I dunno ...".  Then, in the middle of the night you snap awake with the solution.  Now the trick is to either remember the answer in the morning.  Or if like me, keep a small notepad and pen on the nightstand so I can quickly scribble down the answer ... now in the morning, I only need to remember that the midnight epiphany occurred.

My morning-discovered scribble said "Schottky".  Of course, unlike the normal silicon signal or rectifier diode, which is a dual-semiconductor positive (P) to negative (n) doped junction, a Schottky diode is semiconductor to metal.  Unlike a normal silicon diode with a forward-bias voltage drop of approximately 0.7 volts, a Schottky diode only produces approximately a 0.2 volt forward-bias voltage drop.

Updating the math above, the 4.1 volt solar batteries should then provide 3.9 volts after the Schottky diodes, minus the 2.5 volts due to the 22 AWS wire from front to back yard, yielding approximately 3.6 volts a the LED controllers.  This would provide over 1 volt of window between first-illuminated voltage to the LED controllers, and the measured 2.5 volt drop-out voltage, which is a much more acceptable solution.

Schematic for Schottky diode protected parallel solar cells / batteries:

![Schottky diode parallel power](/images/analog-FOUND-IT-blingstar-solar-christmas-lights-LED-string-retrofit-schottky-diode-power-20221120.png)

The one (1) ohm resistors provide a test point for amount of current each solar cell / battery is providing.

# "If you think you've mastered the _Angels in the Details_ of a project ... guess again" Updates

The breadboarding experimentation matched the mathematical calculations.

The series solar batteries plus voltage converter architecture was replaced with the parallel solar batteries plus Schottky diode architecture.

With the soldering iron cooling down, I took the new power box out to the solar cell batteries, and prepared to plug everything together.

It was a beautiful, very sunny, and relatively warm early-winter day.  Very sunny.

I don't know what made me double-check the solar cell battery voltage, but luckily I did:  __6.8 volts!__

Unclear what the over-voltage threshold of the LED controllers is, but given they were designed to operate at 4.5 volts (max) via the three "AA" batteries, I would imagine that nearly 7 volts would cause damage or destruction.

Up until now the solar cell battery voltage was never a consideration (though I should have thought to check after all this time!) because I either had a boost or buck voltage converter, and either had a large input voltage range and 7 volts would not be an issue.

But now with the Schottky diode design, the output voltage would always be 0.2 volts below the solar cell voltage.

Sigh ... yet the next thing to figure out.

OK, time to get to work.

At first I thought, this is straight-forward: I'll create a simple voltage comparator circuit and if the voltage exceeds a TBD threshold  (say, 5.0 volts), simply disconnect the solar battery power from the LED controller via a transistor or relay.

But then I realized, that won't work.  Once power is removed from the LED controller, they lose their memory for on/off timer, and which illumination pattern was set (steady-on, flashing, etc.)  That means every night after a very sunny day, I would need to trudge outside and restart the LED controllers ... not operationally optimal at all.

After a couple more midnight awakenings, I figured out one possible solution.

Going back to the basic facts of how the solar cell charging integrated circuit (IC) works, plus how the overall architecture works through the course of a 24 hour cycle, the solution is a little more complicated than desired, but it does appear to work.

The both the solar cells (charging) and LED controllers (discharging) are by-design connected together and also connected to the charging IC's input voltage.  The charging IC then manages the current into the Li-Ion battery (charging) and out of the battery (discharging).  That's how the IC provides over-voltage/over-current/over-heating of the Li-Ion battery.  In a typical solution not using solar cells for charging and their associated very wide range of output voltage, a regulated power supply would be used and it would be set to be just a little higher voltage than the 4.1 volts of the Li-Ion battery, and that slightly higher voltage would be compatible with whatever is the circuit being battery-operated.

In my current situation, the solar cells will produce the 6.8 volts under very sunny conditions, but decay down to zero volts produced by the solar cells in darkness (that's where the batteries take over and provide evening illumination.)  Throughout this journey, I have been very sensitive to the amount of power consumption of the various architectures tested, to maximize how long the LED controllers and thier LEDs can run on a single charge.  But here, on very sunny days, the solar cells are actually producing too much power ... so it's ok to be a little wasteful, so long as not so wasteful that the solution begins drawing current out of the batteries.

A 5 volt LM340T5 (7805) linear series voltage regulator is considered "low power" though everything is relative, and I would not consider it "ultra low power" which is what I have been designing to.

And a 5 volt coil double-pole double-throw (DPDT) normally-open + normally-closed (NO-NC) contacts relay is definitely not considered "ultra low power".

However these two components together are still easily powered by the three (3) solar cells connected in parallel; each solar cell is actually capable of producing quite a bit of current.

In my new "Over-voltage protection circuit", there will be two output voltages produced leading to the onboard Schottky diodes:
- The direct solar cell and battery output which may rise to nearly 7 volts but operates in darkness off the batteries at 4.1 volts  
- The 5 volt regulated output from the 7805  

I'll then use a voltage comparator circuit to control the relay.  When the solar cell and battery voltage is below 5 volts, this direct output passes through the relay's normally-closed terminals to the LED controllers ... this is safe / fine because the LED controllers, though designed to run at 4.5 volts, most-likely can handle 5.0 volts without damage.  However when the solar cell and battery voltage is above 5 volts, the 5 volt regulated 7805 output will be fed to the LED controllers through the normally-open terminals.

Because the 7805 requires approximately 1.5 volts of "overhead input voltage" beyond it's output voltage (thus 6.5 volts at the input of the 7805 regulator), at solar cell and battery voltage of 5 volts, the 7805's output is only around 3.5 volts.  But 3.5 volts is well-above the 2.5 volt drop-out voltage of the LED controllers, so as the source voltage flips between direct solar cell and battery output when below 5 volts, and the 7805's 3.5 volts when solar cell output exceeds 5 volts, the LED controllers should always have power and retain their timer and settings memory.

The TL431 voltage reference is a natural fit in the design.  It's highly accurate, extremely mature and versitile ... and importantly very inexpensive.  Operated in the open-loop mode, what the TL431 does is reduce it's output (cathode) voltage and sink more current when the external Vref reference voltage pin exceeds it's internal 2.5 volt reference voltage.  Essentially the TL431 tries to be an open switch when the external Vref reference voltage is below 2.5 volts and a closed switch when the external Vref reference voltage is above 2.5 volts.  But being a semiconductor circuit, it has voltage drops and parasitic resistances, so in actuality it's not a perfect switch.

I used two (2) 10K resistors to equally-divide the solar cell and battery voltage at the TL341's external Vref reference voltage pin, resulting in 5 volts of solar cell and battery voltage being presented as 2.5 volts at the external Vref reference voltage pin.

Finally, the TL431 does require approximately 1 milliamp of output (cathode) current to operate, so using a 2.2K resistor on the cathode will produce a couple milliamps of quiescent current.

TL431 5 Volt trigger testing - the TL431 cathode sharply goes low when the 2.5 volt internal reference voltage is exceeded:

![TL431 Circuit - 5.08 volts on 1.92 volts](/images/analog-FOUND-IT-blingstar-solar-christmas-lights-LED-string-retrofit-tl431-5-volt-trigger-IMG_0244-5.08V-on-1.92V-20221124.JPG)

We need to convert the TL431's "closed switch to ground at high external reference voltage" signal into a control signal to close the 5 volt coil DPDT relay's normally-open (NO) terminal, applying the output of the 7805 regulator's voltage to the relay's common terminal, sending that voltage to the LED controllers, instead of the now-too-high normally-closed (NC) terminal's direct solar battery voltage.  This is easily achieved by using a general purpose PNP bipolar junction transistor (BJT).  I selected the common 2N2907 PNP transistor for this purpose - also mature, versatile and inexpensive.  Simply use a 10K resistor between the TL431's cathode and the 2N2907's base lead to limit the base current.

N.B.: There is significant conflicting diagrams and information on the exact pinout of the 2N2907 transistor in the TO-92 package.  There are actually quite a few datasheets and diagrams depicting collector-base-emitter (CBE), though my recollection was always emitter-base-collector (EBC).  Under very low current conditions, say powering an LED through a 1K resistor, breadboarding the 2N2907 CBE or EBC will sort-of result in working either way.  To truly determine which lead is the emitter and which is the collector, you need to measure the voltage across leads 1 and 3 with a saturated base current (forcing the transistor to be "full-on".)  If the voltage is more than 100 millivolts then you have the transistor leads 1 and 3 backwards.  Using this approach, I confirmed the correct pinouts for my batch of 2N2907 transistors is EBC.

And of course, remember to include the reverse-biased rectifier diode across the relay coil, so the inductive kick reverse current produced when the PNP transistor cuts voltage to the coil does not blow the transistor.

Finally, it would be nice to have an onboard LED illuminate when we are at too-high-voltage situation and the power supplied is the 7805 regulator's output.  Easily done by placing an LED and 10K resistor in parallel with the relay coil.

Now let's construct a complete over-voltage protection circuit:
